# Code documentation

One of the most important source of information when you are working on any code project is the documentation. The better the documentation, the faster you will be able to understand a project, its components, and thus get started on updating the project.

We can consider two main types of documentation :
- General documentation, that we will conver in [this chapter](). It generally contains the installation instruction, developer instructions, code of conducts, etc...
- Code documentation

In this section, we will focus on the second one.

Code documentation is all the documentation written within the code. Someone could make the assumption that we are talking about comments and function's docstrings. This is a part of it but in reality code documentation extends all the way to the names of your variables, functions, classes, files, and everything that is code-related inside your project.

In this section, I will introduce general rules about code documentation.
