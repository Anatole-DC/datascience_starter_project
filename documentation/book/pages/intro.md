# How I do projects

_<h4 align="center">By [Anatole-DC](https://github.com/Anatole-DC)</h4>_

This book is a collection of personal tips and advices acquired from all the experience I have acquired from both professional and personnal projects, wether in datasciences or in web and embedded software cases.

This book was intended for Le Wagon datascience's bootcamp. But I do believe it can be useful for any python beginner developer.
