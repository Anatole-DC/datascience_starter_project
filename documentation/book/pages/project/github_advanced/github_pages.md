# Github pages

Github pages allow you to host static web pages on github. If you are reading from your web browser, this is what I use to host this course ! You can also use it to host your github slides, static html pages, etc...

```{note}
To use github pages for free, your github repository's visibility must be set in "public" mode.
```
