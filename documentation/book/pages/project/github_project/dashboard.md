# Github dashboard

For simple to medium sized projects, instead or tools like Notion or Trello, I would advise to use [github projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects). The reason is still that you want to keep the amount of tools you use to a minimum.

This is also because closing issues will update the dashboard automatically.

```{note}
Github projects are very recent, so still a work in progress, but it gets the job done.
