# Scripts

This directory is where to place all non-python files, such as installation scripts or complexe [Makefile](../makefile) instructions. These can be :
- Dataset download
- Libraries build
- Environment setup

This is different from the [project's CLI commands](/package/cli/README.md), that will use package functions directly.
